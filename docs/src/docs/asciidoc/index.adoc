== Why Apiator?

In our team we prefer to use tools that make life of developer easier.
Apiator is one of them.
It helps you to build entire API documentation with minimal configuration.

The motivation is to take information about API usage directly from a source code
and spend as little as possible time and lines of code to describe your API.

Of course it's difficult to predict all of the possible cases of API frameworks configuration so our second goal is high configurability.
You can override or extends almost every functionality of –êpiator with help of type safe configuration code (not a configuration file)!
