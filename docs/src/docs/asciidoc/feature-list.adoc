== Features overview

. Zero additional code for basic documenting
+
An annotations configuration of web-frameworks (like jax-rs or micronaut) is quite good basic description of your API.
We just deliver it in a different way.
+

. Static generation (doesn't affect you production code)
+
You documentation can be generated during the build and can be deployed separately of your project.
Or not (up to you)
+

. JSON representation
+
All parsed API can be represented as reproducible JSON. You can store it in VCS
(like link://git-scm.com[git])
and watch the difference between versions
(go to detailed link:#_core_json_renderer[description]):
+

. HTML representation
+
In a few moments you API will converted into human friendly page (go to detailed link:#_core_html_renderer[description]):
+

image::main_window.jpg[title="HTML representation",align="center",width="550",window="_blank",link="{imagesdir}/main_window.jpg"]

. JavaDoc processing
+
Extend you Api information with native JavaDoc support.
Now you documentation is served directly from you api classes
+

. Single file HTML representation
+
All images and scripts are incorporated in one file which can be open in any browser of even sent via e-mail
+

. And much more in the future :)
