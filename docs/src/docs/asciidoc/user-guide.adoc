== User Guide

Default representation of Apiator collected data is class ApiScheme.
It contains all API method (with class hierarchy) and meta information from annotations (from provider) and JavaDoc.
It's difficult to use such data in a raw view therefore there are renderers.

Let's see the main Apiator entities at the next configuration example (written in groovy to reduce amount of lines):

[source,groovy]
----
Apiator apiator = new Apiator(
    new ApiatorConfig(
            basePackage: 'com.ainrif.apiator.test.model.jaxrs.smoke',
            provider: new JaxRsProvider(),
            renderer: new CoreHtmlRenderer({
                plugins << new JaxRsCompositePlugin()
            }),
            docletConfig: new DocletConfig(includeBasePackage: 'com.ainrif')
    )
)
----

This code configuration uses:

- link:#_providers[Provider] which understands jax-rs frameworks,
- link:#_renderers[Render] which produces html view for api
- link:#_core_json_renderer__plugins[Plugin] for renderer that adds special model types for jax-rs frameworks
- link:#_javadoc_support[Doclet support] and required base package to scan.
