== Renderers

Renderers describe how does Apiator output should look. 
In general renderers are transformers from internal Apiator scheme to something like JSON, XML, HTML, etc.

[#_core_json_renderer]
=== Core JSON renderer

This renderer is a JSON representation of internal Apiator Schema. 
It can be used as input source data for other renderers (like link:#_core_html_renderer[HTML Renderer])
or for comparison of different api versions. +
The result output can be customized with link:#_core_json_renderer__plugins[Plugins]

==== Model description

The top level of resulting JSON represents next data:

- apiContexts - list of all contexts that were found (usually coincides with the class in java)
- apiatorInfo - technical information about Apiator version and settings
- clientApiInfo - additional information provided by Api creator
- usedApiTypes - list of business domain objects
- usedEnumerations - list of enums (sets of string constants)

===== JSON Representation of Api Type

NOTE: *Api Type* - the common abstraction for all the complex types (not : `STRING`, `LONG`, `ARRAY`... ) +
All _Api Types_ which are used as params or return types obey the link:#_model_type[Model Type] abstraction

Basic structure of _Api Type_ includes only two fields

- modelType - one of Model Type set
- type - string with Api Type name (only if modelType is `OBJECT`)

Additional fields of _Api Type_  are used for _Templates Types_ (aka Java Generics)

- basedOn - array of Templates, structure of nested objects is also Template Type
- templateName - name of template variable used in source code

NOTE: Many of others Types inherit the _Template type_ structure

===== Api Context

NOTE: JSON fields with value `null` are omitted in result output. They are presented in the next example only in demo purpose.

  /*...*/
}
----

<1> name of HTTP method to call this endpoint
<2> handler name in a source code
<3> available parameterization for this endpoint
<4> template type information (like Generics in Java)
<5> path to endpoint related to context path (6)
<6> prefix path to the endpoint

===== Used Api Types and Enumerations

Example of JSON representation:
[source,json]
----
{
 "fields": [
   {
     "basedOn": [],
     "modelType": "LONG",
     "name": "id",
     "readable": true,
     "writable": false
   },
   {
     "basedOn": [],
     "modelType": "STRING",
     "name": "firstName",
     "readable": true,
     "writable": true
   },
   /*...*/
 ],
 "modelType": "OBJECT",
 "type": "org.example.library.Author"
}
----

`readable/writable` mean that server have getters / setters for those fields (or they are public in java terms)

Enumeration is kind of Api type:
[source,json]
----
{
  "modelType": "ENUMERATION",
  "type": "org.example.library.Book$Status",
  "values": [
    "PUBLISHED",
    "DRAFT",
    "REPRINT"
  ]
}

[#_model_type]
==== Model Type

_Model Types_ are Apiator internal types which exists to classify every processed object

[cols="1,1,2" options="header"]
|===
|ModelType |Example |Description


| `VOID` `BOOLEAN` `BYTE` `INTEGER` `LONG` `FLOAT` `DOUBLE` `STRING`
| `java.lang.Long` `long` `java.lang.String`
| correspond to native JDK types

| `DICTIONARY` `ARRAY` `SET`
| `java.util.Map` `String[]` `java.util.Set`
| describe different types of collections

| `DATE` `BINARY`
| `java.util.Date` `byte[]` `java.io.InputStream`
| custom types which can be represented as well known format

| `ENUMERATION`
| `java.lang.Thread.State`
| class which describes inheritors of `java.lang.Enum`

| `OBJECT`
| `org.UserDto` (user-defined class)
| this model type is used for custom classes which are exposed via API as part of interface. 
  Such classes will be introspected recursively to determine types of their fields

| `ANY`
| `java.lang.Object`
| this type means Apiator cannot get useful info about such class. 
  It is type for general classes.

| `SYSTEM`
| `java.lang.Class` `java.lang.reflect.Field`
| internal type. 
  Is used to show that given class shouldn't be introspected. 
  If such type have appeared in you documentation in most cases it means you API exposes some language dependent internals

[#_core_json_renderer__plugins]
==== Plugins

Plugins are generic mechanism to extend and override link:_core_json_renderer[Core JSON Renderer] behavior.

All plugins implement `CoreJsonRendererPlugin` interface and can be combined in `CompositePlugin` for ease of use.

NOTE: Plugins with *suffix* `{multiply}CompositePlugin` contain all available plugins with it's *prefix* .
      I.E.: **JaxRs**CompositePlugin contains JaxRs**ModelTypePlugin**, JaxRs**ParamPlugin**...

[#_model_type_plugin]
===== ModelTypePlugin

These plugins encapsulate the logic of classes to _Model Types_ matching.
The matching goes while _Model Type_ wouldn't be found or plugins run out. 
From one plugin to another along the chain.

The `ModelTypePlugin` interface contains only one method returning whether `ModelType` or `null`. 
If plugin returns `null` next plugin will be used.

NOTE: The order of this type of Plugins is important. 
      So non-default plugins are processed first, i.e. in LIFO order of addition

The plugins are *ON* by default `DefaultModelTypeCompositePlugin`:

- AnyModelTypePlugin
- CollectionsModelTypePlugin
- BinaryModelTypePlugin
- OldDateModelTypePlugin
- CoreJavaModelTypePlugin
- Jsr310ModelTypePlugin

And some custom plugins which can be used to extend amount of known types

- JaxRsModelTypePlugin

[#_propery_plugin]
===== PropertyPlugin

This type of plugin allows to customize fields representation of model objects.
By default _Properties_ are public fields and properties in terms of JavaBeans (get{multiply} & set{multiply} methods)

Available Plugins:

- JacksonPropertyPlugin - support link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] property annotations

[#_param_plugin]
===== ParamPlugin

`ParamPlugins` allows to extend information about endpoint param (like default value or optional).

Available Plugins:

- JaxRsParamPlugin - supports `@DefaultValue`

[#_core_html_renderer]
=== Core HTML renderer

Reference HTML representation of Apiator results. 
This renderer produces the most complete graphic interface according to core model. 
Html Render extends configuration from Json Renderer with path to output file.
