== Development Guide

Requirements: 

- Gradle 5.3 to build apiator plugin
- JDK 11 to build and test all Apiator modules
- Node.js 10 to develop Core Html Renderer 

=== Core HTML renderer

The `package.json` is located in source root of html renderer view - `renderer/core-html-renderer/src/main/node`.
To run dev version on http://localhost:1234 execute next commands: 

[source,sh]
----
; npm i
; npm run dev
----

Html renderer is based on Json Render so there is a prepared dataset (json) which represents all features available in Apiator.
It's located at `renderer/core-html-renderer/src/main/node/apiator/js/apiatorJsonStub.js` and is used by default in dev mode.
There is a task from root gradle project to regenerate this json:

[source,sh]
----
; # use wrapper version according to your OS 
; ./gradlew generate_stub
----

The generated stub can be committed into the repo as is without additional formating to keep history of changes.
